## ðŸ“¬  **Email Template**

Currently live at https://email-template.now.sh/

A quick tool for creating `mailto` template links to share on social for quickly drafting emails.

Created with the intention of helping people email their political representatives & sharing one-click links for helping others to do so as well.

All info is stored in the URL and is all client side, email data is only sent to tinyUrl as a url in order to shorten it.

Inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/babybirdrobbins/status/1268563584147054599)


### Contributing

If anyone would like to contribute, please feel free! I'd appreciate it. Would love some help to add more rich text features like bold & inline links. 

Thanks to [Saba](https://twitter.com/SabaSob) & [Peri](https://twitter.com/perilanglois) for helping with this.
