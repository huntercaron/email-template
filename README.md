## ðŸ“¬ **Email Template**

Currently live at https://email-template.now.sh/

A quick tool for creating `mailto` template links to share on social to quickly draft emails.

Created with the intention of helping people email their political representatives & sharing one-click links for helping others to do so.

All info is stored in the URL and is all client side.
